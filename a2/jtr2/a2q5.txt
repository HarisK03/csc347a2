$1$xyz$/gkzk7Xbmpk0MDz1wxr6W0 = password1234!

For this one, the following command was user to crack and retrieve the password:

hashcat -m 500  -a 0 md5.hash    top10mil.txt --potfile-path=hc.pot --session=top10m_md5

We used the top 10 million most command password list (available here https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials/Pwdb_top-10000000.txt) and with this list, the hashcat command tells hashcat the hash is in md5 format, -a 0 means attack each line in the wordlist, the md5.hash contains the hash (separated from the other 2), top10mil.txt is the wordlist, and the potfile tells hashcat where to put the cracked passwords.
